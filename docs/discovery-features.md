# Discovery Features

The Discovery section is designed to help university students explore people, vibes, and communities organically — without pressure, heavy swiping, or forced dating intent.

## 1. Vibe-Based Feed

Instead of a generic swipe deck, users land on a dynamic discovery feed curated by vibes.

**Vibes include:**
*   🎧 Music taste
*   🎮 Gaming
*   📚 Academic interests
*   🎨 Creative hobbies
*   🍔 Food & hangout preferences
*   🏀 Sports & fitness

**Feed updates daily based on:**
*   User activity
*   Trends across campus
*   New signups with similar interests

## 2. Interest Rooms (Social Discovery)

Users can enter interest-based rooms instead of browsing profiles individually.

**Examples:**
*   “Late Night Coders”
*   “Gym After 6PM”
*   “Afrobeats Only”
*   “Startup Builders”
*   “Introverts Who Love Deep Talks”

**Each room shows:**
*   Active users
*   Live prompts (questions, polls)
*   Quick nudges (👋, 🎵, 😂)

## 3. Campus Trends & Moments

A live section highlighting what’s hot on campus right now.
*   **Trending interests:** Most active vibes.
*   **Popular prompts:** e.g., “Who’s pulling up to Java tonight?”
*   **Anonymous confessions:** Moderated content to keep Discovery feeling alive and local.

## 4. Soft Introductions (No Hard Swiping)

Discovery prioritizes low-pressure interactions:
*   Send a **“Nudge”** instead of a like.
*   React to someone’s **vibe card**.
*   Join the same **interest room**.
*   Answer the same **prompt**.

*Only after mutual engagement does full chat unlock.*

## 5. Discovery Challenges

Gamified discovery mechanics to encourage exploration.

**Examples:**
*   “Find 3 people with your exact music taste”
*   “Match with someone from a different faculty”
*   “Join 2 new interest rooms today”

**Rewards:**
*   Badges
*   Profile boosts
*   Streaks

## 6. Anonymous Discovery Mode

For privacy-conscious users:
*   Browse Discovery anonymously.
*   Join rooms without revealing profile.
*   Reveal identity only after mutual interest.

*Perfect for shy users and first-time signups.*

## 7. Smart Profile Teasers

Instead of full profiles, Discovery shows teasers:
*   One vibe
*   One prompt answer
*   One fun stat (“Night owl 🌙”)

This reduces judgment and encourages curiosity.

# AI Logic for Vibe Matching

The AI matching system focuses on compatibility, energy, and shared context, not appearance.

### 1. Vibe Vector Scoring
Each user has a dynamic Vibe Vector calculated from:
*   Selected interests
*   Prompt answers
*   Room participation
*   Nudges sent/received
*   Time-of-day activity patterns

### 2. Context-Aware Matching
Matching logic adapts based on intent and time:
*   **Daytime:** Academic & productivity vibes.
*   **Evenings:** Social & hangout vibes.
*   **Weekends:** Fun & exploration vibes.

### 3. Compatibility Over Popularity
The algorithm avoids showing only “popular” profiles:
*   Prioritizes mutual relevance.
*   Boosts quieter but compatible users.
*   Avoids repetitive profile exposure.

### 4. AI Prompt Alignment
Users are matched based on how similarly they answer prompts.
*   *Example:* Two users choose “Staying in”. AI checks why (reading, gaming, rest) and matches users with aligned intent.

### 5. Micro-Feedback Learning
The AI continuously learns from:
*   Ignored vs. accepted nudges.
*   Time spent in rooms.
*   Repeat interactions.

### 6. Exploration vs. Comfort Balance
The system balances:
*   **Comfort matches:** Very similar vibes.
*   **Exploration matches:** Slightly different but complementary vibes to avoid echo chambers.

### 7. Ethical & Privacy-First AI
*   No facial analysis.
*   No sensitive trait inference.
*   Transparent matching reasons (e.g., “Matched because you both love late-night coding”).
